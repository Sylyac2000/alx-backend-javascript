* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: python3  (and gcc 9.3.0)
* Version: MySQL  8.0.25
* Style guidelines: [Pycodestyle] (https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle)


## Synopsis
This repository holds some javascript projects I worked on at ALX SPECIALIZATION.


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* run javascript using NodeJS
* use NodeJS modules
* use specific Node JS module to read files
* use process to access command line arguments and the environment
* create a small HTTP server using Node JS
* create a small HTTP server using Express JS
* create advanced routes with Express JS
* use ES6 with Node JS with Babel-node
* use Nodemon to develop faster

## General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using node (version 12.x.x)
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the js extension
* Your code will be tested using Jest and the command npm run test
* Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint
* Your code needs to pass all the tests and lint. You can verify the entire project running npm run full-test
* All of your functions/classes must be exported by using this format: module.exports = myFunction;

## Configuration files
